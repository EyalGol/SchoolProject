        Jordison was born at Mercy Hospital in Des Moines, Iowa on April 26, 1975 to Steve and Jackie Jordison. He is the oldest and only boy of 3 children.[2] He grew up in a rural area outside of Waukee where he used to play basketball on the street in front of his house. He embraced music at an early age, which he attributes to his parents' influence: "They always sat me down in front of the radio, rather than the TV."[2] He played guitar until receiving his first drum kit as a gift from his parents at age eight, and started his first band while in elementary school.[3]
        Jordison's parents divorced when he was young. He and his two younger sisters stayed with their mother.[4] His mother remarried and set up a funeral parlor where Jordison would occasionally help. Jordison has stated that he felt a sudden responsibility to be the man of the house. During this time, he formed the band Modifidious, in which he played drums. He later described them as "total speed-metal thrash".[5] The band helped Jordison break new ground, playing live as support to local bands including Atomic Opera, featuring Jim Root, and Heads on the Wall, featuring Shawn Crahan.[6] He also played at a bowling center his family owned, on a night called "Rock and Roll Bowl". After a multitude of lineup changes – including Craig Jones and Josh Brainard, who would reappear in Slipknot – the band released two demos in 1993: Visceral and Mud Fuchia.[6][7] 
        On November 28, 1995, Mark Anthony Cadavos approached Jordison while he was working, offering him a position in a new project called The Pale Ones.[11] Intrigued and at a point where he was "lost",[14] Jordison attended rehearsals at Anders Colsefini's basement and immediately wanted to be part of this new band. Speaking of this moment he said, "I remember trying so hard not to smile, so I didn't look like I wanted to join, I remained poker-faced, but I thought they ruled."[15] A lot of Slipknot's early development was discussed by band members while Jordison worked night shifts at Sinclair's garage.[16] Of the eventual nine members, Joey was the third to join the band. Slipknot would become pioneers to the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.[17][18] Jordison is accompanied by two custom percussionists,[19] giving their music a feel that Rolling Stone touted as "suffocating".[20]
        Each member of Slipknot is assigned a number; Joey was assigned "#1" because drums are recorded first.[21] Joey has produced one album with Slipknot: 2005 live album 9.0: Live.[22] In August 2008, Jordison broke his ankle and Slipknot had to cancel some of its English tour dates.[23] On August 22, 2009, Jordison was taken to the emergency room for a burst appendix, less than an hour before he was to take the stage for Auburn, Washington's KISW Pain in the Grass concert.[24][25] As a result, Slipknot canceled following shows in August and September, to give Jordison time to recover.[26]
        In August 2010 Jordison was voted the best drummer of the previous 25 years by readers of Rhythm magazine, ahead of drummers such as Mike Portnoy, Neil Peart, Phil Collins, and Dave Grohl. When asked to comment he stated "I'm at a loss for words. This is beyond unbelievable. Something like this reminds me every day why I continue to do this."[27][28]
        On December 12, 2013, Slipknot announced through their official website that Jordison had left the band, citing personal reasons for his departure.[29] In response, Jordison released a statement insisting that he had in fact been fired from the band and stated that Slipknot "has been my life for the last 18 years, and I would never abandon it, or my fans".[30]
        After years of both sides being silent and evasive as to the reasons for his leaving the band, Jordison revealed in June 2016 that he suffered from transverse myelitis, a neurological disease which cost him the ability to play the drums toward the end of his time with Slipknot.[13]
