    <hr />
    <p>
        The band's expectations towards Ehmke were very high, expectations not disappointed, but rather confirmed by the band that declared "for us he is our winning bet". The single "Fly" was Ehmke's first work with the Blind Guardians. Ehmke is today the youngest member of the Blind Guardian, because the one who was the youngest, Marcus Siepen, is 10 years older than him.
        Ehmke also played in the folk metal band Schattentantz since his initial training in 1999, where in addition to being a drummer he played the bagpipe and played with percussion and as a singer. The band now temporarily needs to replace Ehmke on stage until the end of his Blind Guardian engagements. Moreover, since 2008 Frederik has been a member of the Sinbreed, a power metal band with only one full-lenght released in 2010, When Worlds Collide.
        A particularity regarding Frederik is that he always plays barefoot.
