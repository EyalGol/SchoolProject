        This is the story of Audie Murphy, the most decorated US soldier in WW2. There are simply too many stories about his deeds to even try to cover them in such a short text, but among his fellow soldiers he was truly a hero and a great inspiration. When he returned from the war he suffered heavily from post-traumatic stress (back then called shell shock) and after a long time on medicines he finally locked himself into a motel for 1 week to cure his addiction of the drugs. After this he became a very famous movie star and even acted in the movie about himself.
