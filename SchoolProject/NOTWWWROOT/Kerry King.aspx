    <p>
        Kerry Ray King was born in Los Angeles, California. His father was an aircraft parts inspector, and his mother was an employee of a telephone company.[1] King attended Warren High School in Downey, California, and started learning guitar at Calvano's Music in South Gate.
        In school, King was a good student who excelled in math. However, his grades slowly declined after he "discovered" girls. He said it worked out in the end because he did not plan to go to college. King confesses that he is an experienced drinker, but he has never done drugs in his entire life.[2]
        In 1981, King was at a session trying out for the position of guitarist in a band. After the session was over Jeff Hanneman approached him and the two began playing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs with the session's drummer. King and Hanneman subsequently decided to start their own band.[3]
        King's trademark personal appearance and extensive tattoos were praised to such a degree by Blender Magazine that they once produced a tour of his body ink.[4] King's abbreviation, KFK, was revealed to mean "Kerry Fuckin' King" in the January 2007 Issue of Guitar World.[5] King currently resides in Corona, California.[6]
        King's first experience with a guitar was when he was a child.[12] Steve Huey of AllMusic has commented in his review for Reign in Blood that Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman's demented soloing often mimics the screams of the songs' victims.[13] He also described his and Jeff Hanneman's guitar solos as "wildly chaotic".[14] Thom Jurek, also of AllMusic, described his work on 2006's Christ Illusion as creating "an intensely harrowing and angular riff that changes from verse to verse, through the refrain and bridge, and comes back again."[15]
        King listed Venom, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath as his favorite bands during his teen years.[16] He said once "Anybody who plays heavy music and doesn't cite Sabbath as an influence is lying, because that's where it all started."[17] He cited Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing of Judas Priest as his biggest influences as a guitarist that inspire his style, tone, and gear. He mentioned Eddie Van Halen, Ted Nugent, Ronnie Montrose, Ritchie Blackmore, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Randy Rhoads as other influences.[18]
