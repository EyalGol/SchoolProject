        Brodén founded Sabaton in 1999 with bassist Pär Sundström;[4] he is the lead vocalist and keyboardist[5] and also sometimes plays guitar.[6]
        Brodén is known for wearing an unusual vest with metal plates when performing with Sabaton;[6][7][8] it has been described as resembling a bulletproof vest.[6]
        In 2015, Brodén made a bet with his bandmates that committed him to traveling to Sabaton's next gig on foot; he had forgotten their next engagement was in Trondheim, Norway.
