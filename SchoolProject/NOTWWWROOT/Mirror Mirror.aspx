        "Mirror Mirror" is a single by the German power metal band Blind Guardian, released in 1998. Cover art was painted by Andreas Marshall. The song was composed for the 1998 album Nightfall in Middle-Earth. Lyrics of "Mirror Mirror", based on J. R. R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion, recount how Turgon, in view of inevitable defeat, builds the city of Gondolin, aided by Ulmo ("The Lord of Water").
        The single also includes two songs from Imaginations from the Other Side album of 1995 and a cover version of Judas Priest song "Beyond the Realms of Death" that was also released on A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal split tribute album.
