    <h3> Dawn was born in the very large and well-known city of Twinleaf Town.
         She grew up with a very famous mother, who inspired her to become the most famous actress ever.
         She began her training at the age of five, when she learned how to make "Poffins," small cookies which, when used properly,
         are highly effective bribes.
         Later on she branched off and learned other things, including but not limited to:
         how to look beautiful without having boobs, how to use Pokemon properly,
         and, most importantly, how to be on Pokemon and not wear the same outfit every day.</h3>
