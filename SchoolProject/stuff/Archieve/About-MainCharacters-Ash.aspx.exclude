    <h3> is the very common product of volcanic eruptions that stars in the hit Reality Show Pokemon. The surname Ketchum is derived from the Latin root Catch'em. God just wanted it that way. Ash is a name likely akin to his huge quantities of marijuana that he smoked, leading to the tripped out adventure with an electric rat.
Ash often dresses in his mom's clothes pretending to be a girl called Misty. Why do ya think Brock never fell for Misty? But how come we see Ash and Misty at the same time? That Ash is merely a robot controlled by Pikachu. When You don't see Misty, that's the real Ash.
He also possesses a Justin Bieber Award in Long-term Postponing of Puberty. Even at the age of twenty-three, he remains physically and mentally a dumb shit ten-year-old, although--due to the handy changing of voice actors--his voice has recently grown deeper. This may be a sign of his balls finally dropping. Experts estimate that, at this rate, Ash should begin shamelessly hitting on Misty by season 38. Of course, by then, she and Brock will have started a pimping business, so he'll be out of luck. Pika-pika indeed!</h3>
