    <h3> Misty was born to Heidi Klum and Frank Sinatra in Cerulean City, a large housing division of Bradenton, Florida, during the Nintendo Revolution. 
        Due to the hostile, confusing, and somewhat disturbing environment, 
        Misty had to do whatever she could to survive. 
        At the age of 3, she thought her parents were killed in a drive-by, and she thought she was left to fend for herself. 
        She killed a boy at age four, and realized how much fun a bike really is. 
        Her father was recently discovered to be Trent Reznor, and her mother was Celine Dion which explains why she's such a bitch.</h3>
